3. differences between navigation and snapshot mode in light house:
* navigation mode simulates a full page load and analyzes the overall page performance such as load time and rendering
* Snapshot mode captures a state of a page(like a picture), without reloading it.

Snapshot mode is more useful for analysis of the DOM at a specific point of time while navigation is good for overall performance

4. three things I can do to improve site:
* reduce images somehow since images take awhile to load(performance)
* paginate the contents so that we dont need to load 20 things at once(performance)
* make title of website more meaningful and make sure they are unique and descriptive(Search engine optimization)
